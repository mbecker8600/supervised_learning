Here lies the readme file that will explain how to run the code for the first project for Machine Learning.
I have listed all of the libraries that have been used below as well as the version of Python.

-- Python version --
Python3

-- Dependencies --
pip3 install numpy pandas --user
pip3 install scipy --user
pip3 install sklearn --user
pip3 install scikit-learn --user  (note you need to have 0.18 or higher)

Jupyter Notebook if you want to look at the .ipynb files (more readable and able to execute what you want)

-- Driver file(s) --
Which driver file you run will depend on which dataset you would like to see the results for. The driver files are meant
to run through each model analyzer in order to determine which algorithm best fits the data.

You can run either of the .py files in order to see the results

-- Data directory --
This directory stores all of the data for the given experiment.
